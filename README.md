# Parrot_Sequoia_Image_Handler
Homemade code to deal with Parrot Sequoia Images

Modules will be continuously updated  
  
# Tools included:
  - **Creating_Shp**: Create images waypoints and trajectory shapefile based on photo's geotags  
  - **Sunshine_Normalisation**: Adjust photo's brightness based on the sunshine sensor's measurement  
  - **Calculate_Radiance**: Correct photo's vignetting effect then convert it to radiance with or without panel image.
  
# Note
The tools use the three modules in _Dependency_. Please put them in the same folder.  
exiftool is required. See http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/
